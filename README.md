# Dockerfiles
A collection of Dockerfiles for Linux GUI Applications along with
their desktop shortcuts, all launched using the 
[x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker) utility.

Almost all of the launcher scripts assume that the host has an 
NVIDIA GPU and has 
[nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) installed
to leverage NVIDIA CUDA and OpenGL inside the container.
